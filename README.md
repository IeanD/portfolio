A sampling of websites and design work made by Iean Drew (ieand@uw.edu).

 - [Responsive Design Demo](https://ieand.github.io/responsive_demo/)
  - A website advertising a revolutionary new product like you've never seen... the Pencil!
 - [Javascript Demo](https://ieand.github.io/javascript_demo/)
  - A barebones demo of using Javascript to parse and display the results of a simple JSON database.
 - [Firebase Demo](https://hiya-9a8ea.firebaseapp.com/)
  - A functioning chat application utilizing Firebase as a backend. Warning: Feel free to test it out, but use a burner email! This is a demo.
 - [React Weather Solo Demo](https://ieand.github.io/react_weather_demo/index.html)
  - A functioning, minimalism-based weather web app built using React. I use this guy a lot!
 - [React Project Management Demo #1](https://ieand.github.io/react_PM_demo_1/index.html)
  - My first demo of project management experience. With the help of the wonderful Emily Ye, Emily Zhang and Esther Ohman, we build MovieSoup, a fun movie database website. eCommerce functions intentionally non-functional. PMed by myself.
 - [React/Webpack Project Management Demo #2](https://info343e-au16.github.io/team2-finale/index.html)
  - With some practice under belts, Emily, Emily, Esther and I set out to create something we would actually use on a daily basis, and so Finito was born. Finito is an intentionally simple, visually pleasant to-do web app built using responsive design. Utilizes React and Webpack. PMed by me.
